                Organized by Heresy Major at Mary's Governance in 2026. Featuring words by Bebe Cleaver, Lorne Davis, Hugo

                Unfortunately, there was not a huge turnout, but the attendee was given a free scarf in commemoration of
                the opening. Due to a misunderstanding, the second attendee was doubly cast in the performance and thus
                did not receive a free scarf.

            <h2>Reading by Lorne Davis</h2>
            <p>Editor's note: Must of Davis' reading was sadly rendered unintelligable due to a violent coughing fit.
                That which was able to be transcribed appears below. A * denotes a single cough. Longer or more
                complicated coughs that bleed into eachother and thus cannot be easily counted are denoted in writing.

                <i>** * Honesty! Honesty! THE LAST THING I want is to be accused of being a simpleton. Is this thing on?
                    Oh. ** Well I don't know what I think! 
                    * * I'm a man who has lived many lives, isn't that important? I've sold cars, I've played games,
                    I've fallen off a jet-ski, I've <b>[unintelligable]</b>, I had a one-sided love affair twice, <b>[Long
                        coughing fit] </b> I've gotten shot in the back, been castrated by the court of my peers, sublimated myself for the media circus, done an ecommerce photoshoot, I've even worked in tech. ** 
                    I've dabbled in it all, you see, but at the end of the day when I'm all alone I return to it again
                    and again. My perfect * * seminal quote that I live by. * <b>[Another long
                        coughing fit] </b>
                        
                    But no one else wants to speak in absolutes anymore. And, like I said, the last thing I want is to be
                    accused of being a simpleton. <b>[unintelligable murmur]</b>
                    But am I so wrong for wanting that perfect mantra? Live every day like it's your last. And is it dishonest that my opinion changes violently,
                    drastically, and unpredictably? Sometimes, maybe. <b>[10 seconds of coughing]</b> The truth is
                    that I don't believe the power of words is always greater than the power of silence. What good are
                    words with this terrible case of brain fog? I can barely spell. <b>[I could not for the life of me make out what he said here either -- Lindsay]</b> I'd like to think that I would have
                    been a scribe in Ancient Egypt but deep down inside I know that I'm lying to myself. </i>
