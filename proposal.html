        Project Proposal: Generative Lace
    </h1>
    <p>
       Lace making as an art form dates back to the 1500s, and continues today.
       This project would use a neural network to generate lace patterns.
       I think it could also be interesting to make a website where users can upload images that the NN uses to incorporate in the lace design.
       I'm very open to other variables that could be used to generate the lace designs, like images of flowers or fractal patterns.
       This would be a cool opportunity to learn about the history of lace, and apply twenty-first century tools to try to make some!
       I also think it would be cool to make some of the designs into actual lace, although I'm not sure how to.

    <p>
        Goals:
        <li>
            Generate Lace Patterns based on existing pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            Learn about the history of lace making 
        </li>
        <li>
            Hopefully be able to produce something we generate
        </li>
