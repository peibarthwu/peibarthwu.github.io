            This piece imagines a fantasy world where the user’s movements allow computers to morph into people, playing off an age-old fear of machines becoming too human (and maybe taking over the world). The motion design in the piece means that the viewer has to actively participate in order to view it in its entirety, and the user’s own movements cause the transformations.  
            I began this project wanting to explore the uncanny valley and feelings of unease around machines that seem too human. The term “uncanny valley” refers to a dip in a graph of comfort, but it also sounds like the name of a place, and this virtual world could be just that. 
            I originally wanted to more clearly point to some sort of apocalypse, but fire is very hard to program, and I was instead drawn to American suburban utopic imagery when I came back to the US. The design of this piece is heavily inspired by the architecture of the neighborhood I grew up in, as well as the feeling of being trapped at home this past year. I spent two months sitting at my desk, in front of the window in my childhood bedroom, just like the figures in this piece. The photos behind the figures are images from the dollhouse in my room, another slightly uncanny world that I rediscovered when I came home. I thought it was very fitting! I tend to daydream a lot, and I’m really interested in fantasy worlds as a means of escape.
            The audio is a quote from Siri in this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlZtr9fjQcU) and the music over it is “Every Single Time I Dream” by Greenflow. The morphing is done with morph targets (both the computer and model were created from a cube with 14*6 subdivisions, the animation is scripted on ‘mousescroll,’ and the house model has no backing for optimization.
